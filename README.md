## About Me
I'm an engineering student focused on working with low-level software. Computer design is a passion of mine and I love talking architecture. I enjoy learning new skills and spend my free time on small embedded electronics projects. When I'm not writing software, I am also a musician and have found a fascination with sound synthesis. I have even incorperated this interest into some of my projects.
